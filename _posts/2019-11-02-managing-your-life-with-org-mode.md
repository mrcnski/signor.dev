Today was [EmacsConf 2019](https://emacsconf.org/2019). There were a lot of very interesting and mind-expanding talks about cool stuff and the latest developments in Emacs. The sense of community was brilliant and I had a great time, despite the technical problems.

Of course, I was one of the speakers. Emacs is my favorite piece of software and I was highly excited to participate in the first EmacsConf since I got really into Emacs in 2017. I spent a lot of time preparing, but there still had to be problems with the audio :( Anyway, a link to the presentation is up above, and when the recording is available I'll add that as well. Enjoy!
