Not many people know this, but I used to be quite the Chess prodigy. I was the proud captain and leader of the university Chess club and a high-ranking player in my own right with a lifetime Elo rating of 1600. Many years ago I composed the following game annotations, which I trust you will find most instructive.

## Annotations

- [Queen Huntin'](http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/queen-huntin?gm=44280): An illuminating demonstration of why premature queen thrusts should be avoided.
- [The Lame Knight](http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/the-lame-knight?gm=44281): Develop your pieces safely so that they are not chased around the battlefield.

I may annotate more games if there is interest, despite me retiring from the game long ago at the peak of my powers.
